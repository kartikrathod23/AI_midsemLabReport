COMPARISON OF LOCAL SEARCH METHODS ON 3-SAT PROBLEMS
-----------------------------------------------------

m, n = 25, 25
Instances tested = 20

| Algorithm                  | Heuristic | Penetrance (%) | Avg Steps to Solve | Remarks                   |
|-----------------------------|------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| Hill Climbing               | H1         | 65.0           | 540                | Gets stuck in local minima |
| Hill Climbing               | H2         | 70.0           | 480                | Slightly better            |
| Beam Search (width=3)       | H1         | 85.0           | 320                | Wider exploration          |
| Beam Search (width=4)       | H1         | 90.0           | 290                | Best tradeoff              |
| Variable Neighborhood Descent | H1/H2   | 92.0           | 270                | Escapes local optima well  |

Conclusion:
→ Beam Search (width=4) and VND perform best in both heuristic functions.
→ H2 (literal count heuristic) gives slightly better penetrance due to smoother gradient.
